# Emote emote animation tools

The `.blend` files are [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) projects.  
To use these, use the 2.83 LTS, or the latest version of Blender.  
[Emotecraft wiki](https://kosmx.gitbook.io/emotecraft/tutorial/custom-emotes) if you're stuck.

`.bbmodel` files are models for [Blockbench](https://blockbench.net/) You can use them as well.  
To use them, you'll need to install [GeckoLib](https://geckolib.com/) plugin first.   

Models labled with `_bend` allow you to bend some bones and those labled with `_item` allow you to animate currently held items.
Keep in mind that the visual for bending is incorrect in Blender/Blockbench, there won't be any gaps created by bending a bone in-game.
